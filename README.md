<h1>Office Hours Fixer</h1>
<p>I developed a robot using Java Robot Library to fix over 3000 office hours on a customized application.
The robot basically copies the office hours on to the clipboard and fixes the string by storing it into a binary tree. 
It breaks the string up into pieces and checks for discrepancies and fixes it immediately. Then, the robot pastes this fixed string on to
the customized application and updates it manually. </p>
